# Fractal Renderer

This project is dedicated to rendering fractals. Fractals are intricate, self-similar patterns that exhibit complexity at every scale, and rendering these patterns can produce stunning visual effects. This project is under development, where so far, only the mandelbrot set is covered. 

## Building

In the terms of building, it is recommended to build in release mode `cargo build --release`, as rendering fractals can be heavy, and the optimizations will significantly speed up the rendering process.
It is required that `FFmpeg`, `clang` and `pkg-config` are already installed on your system for being able to build. Go [here](https://github.com/zmwangx/rust-ffmpeg/wiki/Notes-on-building#dependencies)
for further instructions on how to install these dependencies.
